# notepadComp-RPA

This RPA was created on demand from a hospital sector where it needed to compare lists of employee rosters to find out which ones are present in both lists and which ones are missing from one of them. For this, RPA compares the text line by line present in both text files and creates a third notepad with the relevant information for the user.
